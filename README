# ipfs-demo
A quick multi-user drawing demo based on orbit-db example https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db/blob/main/examples/browser/browser.html.

You can create a new database in one browser session. Save that database id string, open it on a different browser/computer, and draw something together in real-time.

## Notes
It looks like current ipfs-js implementation is still using a relay to route traffic between peers.
Tracking https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/issues/385 to see if peers can drop webstar after initial connection and upgrade to true p2p.
